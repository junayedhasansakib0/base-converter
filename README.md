# Base Converter & Arithmetic Calculator

A web-based application for converting numbers between bases and performing arithmetic operations on numbers in any specified base. This tool is designed to help users handle numbers across various bases, supporting both integer and fractional numbers.

## Features

- **Base Conversion**: Converts numbers from one base to another (supports bases between 2 and 36).
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers in a specified base.
- **Universal Conversion Table**: Displays converted values in binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for structure and styling.
- **JavaScript** for functionality, including base conversions and arithmetic operations.
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)** for typography.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a web browser that supports JavaScript enabled.
